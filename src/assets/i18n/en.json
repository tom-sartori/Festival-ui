      "TEXT1": "After a first life in motorsports, at 30 Patrice Coste began a successful turn in the region’s wine-growing landscape. Installed in a private cellar since 2014, its Mas des Rompudes estate boasts a range of Hérault IGP wines full of freshness. ",
      "TEXT2": "It was a family heritage – 12 hectares of vines left vacant on the outskirts of the village of Saint Bauzille de la Sylve in the Hérault region – that put Patrice Coste on the path to vines. Trained in motorsports and graduated from Peugeot Sport School in Clermont-Ferrand after a BTS in auto mechanics, the son and grandson of a winegrower passionate about tasting abandoned engines and racing circuits to begin a quick conversion as a winegrower in his native village in 2013. “My paternal grandfather died leaving behind 6 hectares of vines. My maternal grandfather, who owned another 6 hectares, was retiring without a buyer, he recounts.I brought these two islands together to become a winemaker, first as a co-operator at the winery of Saint-Bauzille de la Sylve, then as an independent winemaker with the desire to always carry out these two activities at the same time. »"

      "TEXT1": "A good driver, Patrice Coste knows his roadmap by heart: in 2014 after training in viti-oeno, he isolated 1 ha of vines to create his estate, Le Mas des Rompudes.",
      "TEXT2": "It is oriented towards a very simple range of wines claimed in the PGI of Hérault around a texture of freshness, with lots of fruit: two reds of which 7000 bottles will be sold in 2014, a rosé “Les Mages” which came in 2015 to complete the range, followed in 2016 by a white wine, “La Capitelle”. Dominant Syrah, Grenache and Alicante (15%). by cuvée), the cuvées “Les Cresses” and “Les Hauts de Tabaussac” red with a very deep violet colour, affirm a certain bias of freedom in this wine-grower. “Initially I kept the old vines of Alicante, valuing them to stand out from the lot, it was a way to stand out and then the vines had been planted by my grandfather. But very quickly in tasting, this dyeing variety has established itself because it brings freshness and a menthol side to the wine”, explains Patrice Coste. In the same spirit on the cellar side, the winemaker has chosen a 100% aging in stainless steel vats to preserve a maximum of freshness to the wines; and a vertical wooden cage press (The old pressoir but in hydraulic version), complemented by a night harvest to avoid oxidation caused by temperature changes."

      "TITLE": "PDO, olive oil and truffle oaks",
      "TEXT": "In 2017, a new stone vault on the Pont du Gard and an underground cellar were built. They will allow the storage of future oak barrels of the estate. Because Patrice Coste aims to expand its range with an AOP wine in the coming years, following the purchase of 3 ha on the heights of Saint-Bauzille in the era of appellation Grès de Montpellier. Also planned for the future: diversification with the production of olive oil on the estate (as soon as the 300 olive trees planted in 2014 on 1.30 ha will return to production), and in the longer term, a truffle oak breeding in the scrubland adjacent to the vineyard."
